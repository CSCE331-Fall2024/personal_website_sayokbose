At the top, above the section with the two cols, add a textbox where I will put in the prompt I used to create this page. I want. you to style in in a modern, sleek way but make it unique and futuristic to fit the theme of AI. furthermore, all the classes and id names of the HTML elements should end find _ai</p>

                    <p class="p_ai">Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, or music. It leverages large language models (LLMs) that are trained on vast datasets to produce coherent and contextually relevant outputs. Machine learning, a broader subset of AI, involves training algorithms on data to recognize patterns and make decisions. These technologies are rapidly advancing and are integral to many modern applications.</p>
